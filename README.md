## Problem

In many Nigerian hospitals, patients cannot describe their symptoms effectively due to language barriers. Doctors and patients struggle to communicate, which leads to misdiagnoses and poor healthcare outcomes. 

The idea of this app was conceived after I got to know about an incident of a wrong drug prescription when a doctor misunderstood his patient while explaining his ailment.

**VoiceBridge Naija** is an AI-powered app that helps doctors and patients communicate in their native languages â€” Yoruba, Igbo, or Hausa â€” using voice translation while retaining dialect/intonation.
